implement the following models:
scaffold
fedsam_hessian with scaffold
fedgloss
fedgloss with local sam_hessian

correct fedlesam and its variants

all other models are completed and currently being run on:
1 - CIFAR10/CIFAR100 (in-distribution test under heterogeneous scenarios (realized as synthetic label skew))
2 - PACS and OfficeHome (domain generalization under covariate shifts [realized as feature skew leave-one domain out])
